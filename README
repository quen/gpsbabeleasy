GPSBabel easy converter
-----------------------

This is a GUI for the GPSBabel GPS format conversion system on Mac OS X.

NOTE: I have no connection with the GPSBabel project. For information about
that, see www.gpsbabel.org.

They already have a GUI but I didn't like it.

This is not quite finished, but I thought I'd get it checked into GitHub.
