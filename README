GPSBabel easy converter
-----------------------

This is a GUI for the GPSBabel GPS format conversion system on Mac OS X.

NOTE: I have no connection with the GPSBabel project. For information about
that, see www.gpsbabel.org.

They already have a GUI but I didn't like it.


Status
------

Released.

If you just want to download and run the program, please go to the wiki page
now. (Click the 'Wiki' tab above.)

This readme mostly contains technical details for those interested in building
the application.


Support
-------

No support, but feel free to file issues if you find a problem with the system
(so long as you're sure it is a problem with this wrapper and not a problem
with GPSBabel itself).


Building
--------

To build, just run the Ant build script. It should automatically build onto
your desktop.

You need to build this on a Mac because:

(a) it relies on the Apple Java Extensions. (It's possible to workaround this
    using a stub, but I didn't bother.)

(b) it uses the 'hdiutil' binary to create a DMG file, which is (annoyingly)
    Mac-only.


Other platforms
---------------

The only reason this is Mac-only is that I couldn't be bothered to package it
for other platforms. A few details might need to be tweaked, like how it
finds the native binary, and the Trash support that uses AppleScript.
Otherwise, it's pure Java 6 so porting it should be trivial, if anyone wants.

(If you'd like to contribute a Windows or Linux port back into this repository,
please catch up with me on IRC some time so we can discuss it.)
