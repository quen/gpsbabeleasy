GPSBabel easy converter
-----------------------

This is a GUI for the GPSBabel GPS format conversion system on Mac OS X.

NOTE: I have no connection with the GPSBabel project. For information about
that, see www.gpsbabel.org.

They already have a GUI but I didn't like it.


Status
------

Released. Please see the wiki page for end user documentation (click 'Wiki' tab
above) if you just want to download and run the program.


Building
--------

To build, just run the Ant build script. It should automatically build onto
your desktop.

You need to build this on a Mac because:

(a) it relies on the Apple Java Extensions. (It's possible to workaround this
    using a stub, but I didn't bother.)

(b) it uses the 'hdiutil' binary to create a DMG file, which is (annoyingly)
    Mac-only.
